Prime Minister Modi Ji in France 🙏\n\n7 am we all were there for the Bastille Day parade and he had to stand most of the time.\n12 to 5: Nonstop business meetings with all Business delegates from both countries.\nEvening: We had a special dinner at the Louvre.\n12 am onwards: There were fireworks at the Eiffel Tower.\n\nAfter that, I was so tired. I popped a melatonin, and slept long.\n\nBut, the next morning when I woke up at 11, Modi Ji was already in the UAE, meeting government officials.\n\nFor years, we grew up believing that politicians don't work hard. That belief doesn't stand anymore.\n\nWhen national leaders work with the same intensity (and more) of a startup founder, the least we can do is raise the bar for ourselves. Because building a developed India by 2047 will demand more from each one of us.\n\nHappy Birthday, Modi Ji. Thank you for redefining what leadership looks like🇮🇳"

Just open conversations about the real challenges.\n\nFounders brought up real challenges they were facing. And without hesitation, everyone pitched in with solutions.\n\nThis is what we are about. A founder community where people help people.\n\nBecause, let's face it, balance sheets might not have your back, but people will (Atleast some of them will, hold them tight) 💪"

PM Narendra Modi, President Emmanuel Macron, and global leaders at the CEO Forum with the backdrop of AI Action Summit representing boAt Lifestyle, Make in India, and our startup ecosystem on the global stage 🇮🇳🙏🏻\n\nHere's what I shared:\n\n1. With over 100,000 startups, 100+ unicorns, and being the 3rd largest ecosystem globally, India is a powerhouse of innovation. It's time to connect the dots globally.\n\nFrance should send its best minds to Startup Mahakumbh (April, Delhi), and India must show up at Viva Tech (June, Paris). We need more Founder-led partnerships in the future and France should also leverage programmes like Invest in India.\n\n2. From Importing to Exporting Tech: There was a time when we relied on global giants for tech. Now, we MAKE and EXPORT tech, from boAt headphones to Apple iPhones.\n\nMake in India is a reality. French companies can tap into this wave by partnering with Indian manufacturers, leveraging PLI/PMP schemes, and setting up joint facilities.\n\n3. This forum goes beyond partnerships - it is a call for tech businesses worldwide to drive meaningful solutions for tomorrow.\n\nWe are building, innovating, and creating new possibilities for AI, Smart Manufacturing and tech.\n\nAnd if there is one thing I realized, it is this: The world is watching India. But more importantly, the world wants to work with India\n\nJai Hind. The future is here, and it's MADE IN INDIA 🔥\n\nNamaste and Merci beaucoup 🇮🇳🤝🇫🇷"
